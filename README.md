## Vue-TinyBase

**Warning**: This is a work-in-progress. Avoid using in production.

Documentation is not available, check example typescript app to see how to use it for experiments.

To have typescript support check `packages/examples/todolist-ts/src/store.ts` file.

All event listeners and composables are auto-generated from tinybase `store.d.ts` file, only `valueRef` and `cellRef` are not auto-generated.
